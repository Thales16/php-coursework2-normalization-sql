# Coursework 2 - Normalization & SQL Queries

This repository contains the solution for **Coursework 2**, focused on database normalization, schema design, and SQL data manipulation using MySQL.

##  Assignment Overview
The objective of this assignment was to:
1.  **Normalize** a raw, flat dataset up to the **Third Normal Form (3NF)** to eliminate redundancy.
2.  **Design and implement** a relational database schema in MySQL.
3.  **Populate** the tables with realistic sample data (at least 30 records).
4.  **Execute complex SQL queries**, including aggregations, joins, filtering, and grouping.

##  File Structure

* `normalization_process.md`: Documentation of the normalization steps (1NF, 2NF, 3NF) and the final relational schema.
* `schema.sql`: SQL commands to create the tables (`CREATE TABLE`) with Primary and Foreign Keys.
* `data.sql`: SQL commands to insert sample data (`INSERT INTO`).
* `queries.sql`: The 12 required SQL queries with comments explaining their logic.
* `exported_database.sql`: The full database export (structure + data) generated by phpMyAdmin.

##  How to Import to MySQL

To run this project on your local machine:

1.  Open **phpMyAdmin** (or your preferred MySQL client).
2.  Create a new database (e.g., named `coursework2`).
3.  Click on the **Import** tab.
4.  Choose the file `exported_database.sql` from this repository.
5.  Click **Go/Execute**.

Alternatively, you can run the `.sql` files manually in this order:
1.  Run `schema.sql` to create the tables.
2.  Run `data.sql` to insert the data.
3.  Run `queries.sql` to test the queries.
